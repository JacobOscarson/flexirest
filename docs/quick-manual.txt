Download and Installation
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

Installation using `easy_install`
---------------------------------

You can download and install a Python `egg` from PyPI using
setuptools_::

    $ sudo easy_install flexirest

.. _setuptools: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

Development build
-----------------

`Flexirest` development is hosted on Bitbucket_ (thanks!), using
Mercurial_. You can get a clone of the repository from there::

    $ hg clone http://bitbucket.org/esmljaos/flexirest/

Flexirest is built using buildout_. To build using your Python (>=
2.5.2), just run the `bootstrap.py` script with your Python
interpreter, then run the `bin/buildout` script::

    $ python bootstrap
    [...]
    $ ./bin/buildout

Output formats
++++++++++++++

As of now, that's strictly the same formats that `docutils` itself
provides.

However, I have some ideas of integrating for example Odtwriter_ and
maybe do some post processing tricks in later versions. But we'll see:
I don't want `flexirest` to grow to much.

.. _Odtwriter: http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman/odtwriter.html

What would be useful is a way to output an MS Word `.doc`
file. Although if you - like me - dislike this practice, there's still a
practical reality out there full of people who won't accept anything else
than a `.doc` file.

Styling your HTML output
------------------------

Create a CSS style sheet and link it in your HTML template.

Latest stable version - 0.8
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is the first release of flexirest. It also marks the first time
when flexirest is usable in practice (this document is produced using
flexires, for example). It's still a little rough around the edges,
and I have a few ideas of refinements that I think should be added,
but this is the point where I'm going to start using it myself. So
I'll pick a version number quite close to 1.0 (0.8) and call it that.

Howto
+++++

The basic operation of flexirest as of now is piping the input
directly into the program, Unix style. Output then comes out,
unsuprisingly, on the standard output.

Something like this should therefore be the quickest possible syntax::

    $ flexirest < yourtext.txt > youroutput.html

Default output format is HTML. To choose another writer, use the
--writer/-w option. The writers are named the same as their
corresponding docutils modules.

Then you can also specify a template that your content will be applied
against. This template is just a file with Python markers
corresponding to how you would format a string with a dict ("..." %
{}). For HTML you have 4 attributes that will be changed in your
template:

:html_prolog: XML declaration and DOCTYPE.For HTML, just put it at
	      the top of the template.
:html_head: tags that Docutils wants to put inside your HEAD tag.
:html_body: the generated body HTML.
:lang: language code of your document. Defaults to 'en'.

Which would give us a marginally more elaborate command line syntax::

    $ flexirest < yourtext.txt > youroutput.html --template=yourtemplate.html

Unfortunately, since this inital development has been quite centered
on getting the HTML writer started, documentation ends here. But,
fortunately I want to start typesetting my invoices with flexirest, so
Real Soon Now (tm) I'll start to look into LaTeX writing, and probably
release next version!
