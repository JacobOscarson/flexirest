* Documentation
  * Create roles  *[DONE FOR NOW: PROVIDED LINK]*
  * Better documentation on templates
  * Make the introduction better..
    * Scope discussion (not competing with Sphinx, rst2pdf ect). For
      stand-alone documents: this site an exception for dogfood
      reasons
  * Write a 'recipies' page with generous examples
    * Suggested HTML workflow
  * Add 'extras' (our own css + preferably more stuff) to downloads
    * IDEA: A 'sober.css' extra formal(ish) stylesheet.
    * IDEA: A 'nineties.css' style (blue background.. yellow text?)
    * More?
  * A 'milestones' / future plans kind of page
* Administration
  * Consider migrating this file to bitbuckets ticketing system
  * The top-level tests directory should be named 'tests/' for consistency
* 0.8.2 development
    * In this case, look for <infile>_flexi.py as config module
  * Read about latex writers
    * Investigate Python `tex` package
      * http://pypi.python.org/pypi/tex)
      * --use-tex flag to use it
      * directly to pdf with --writer = 'pytexpdf'
  * --validate flag, only checks syntax (via null-writer..?)
* 0.8.4 Ideas
  * An 'externals' module that pulls 'upstream' renderers/roles from
    e.g the docutils sandbox, rst2pdf, other places and makes them
    available to flexirest.
  * Find use cases with normal tracebacks (not found files etc) and
    state a nice error message instead of just dumping a traceback to
    the console.
